# Capcity Simulator   
Written as a bachelorthesis at Høyskolen i Østfold. By Kristian Eidem, Martin Tysdahl Gedde-Dahl and Joakim Johansen, for Halden County. 

## Description   
This project was worked on through the bachelorgroups final project. This program lets you create a map of a network. This will make you able to do simulations and analysis of the network manually. You can also add how many users are connected to each specific access point to keep track of the network. The simulation will not need to be connected to internett to run simulations, just to upload and to use the database (this is something that is currently being worked on). 

## Installation:
